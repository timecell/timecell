# TimeCell — Project Board

**Last updated:** 2026-02-27 12:15 IST
**Next milestone:** YPO Delhi Demo — Feb 28, 2:30 PM IST

---

## IN PROGRESS

- [ ] **Dashboard UX redesign** — too much data, needs hierarchy: hero survival score > sliders+chart > details below fold
- [ ] **Rebuild + republish to npm** (v0.1.2) — bundle all new features from this session
- [ ] **Verify new components** — conviction ladder, info panel, saved indicator, currency support render correctly

---

## PLANNED (Demo-Critical)

- [ ] **Demo dry run** — full walkthrough per demo-checklist.md, on projector, timed
- [ ] **Logo deploy to Vercel** — push site/ changes so timecell.ai shows logo
- [ ] **Currency default to INR for demo** — audience thinks in crores, show ₹ symbol

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Context |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2026-02-27 | Currency: option 2 (with conversion) for long-term | Math is currency-agnostic, but INR users need ₹ display + live conversion |
| 2026-02-27 | Logo: v3-3 (orange circle+dot + wordmark) | Finalized after 5 rounds of iterations |
| 2026-02-27 | Number shorthand: simple suffix parsing, no AI | k/m/b/cr/l covers Western + Indian notation |
| 2026-02-27 | Dashboard UX: needs redesign — too data-heavy | Prioritize emotional impact for demo: survival score hero > interactive sliders > details |
